# Accounts

Accounts are essential for everyone to continue using the Goat Slider app, it's the only way to create sliders, but an account is free and can be opened with few clicks using Google.

## Use It Across All Your Webflow Accounts

Your account is connected to your Google account and not to your Webflow account, which means you can use it across all your Webflow accounts and workspaces without limitations at all.

## How To Create An Account

In the app, you will see a user icon by default when the user is not signed in with an account. If you are signed in, you should see your avatar. To sign in, click the user icon, and then a popup will be shown from Google. Choose your desired Google account to join, and that's all.
