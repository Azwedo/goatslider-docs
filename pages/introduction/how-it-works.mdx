# How It Works

How it works is very simple, you get the app from Marketplace, open and create a customized slider based on your needs, and paste it into your Webflow project, then just publish that. Tada!

Then when the slider is published, we take care of the slider using our library that is injected on your slider. So this is basically all in short how it works. Below we will walk step by step on how to create a slider.

    All the sliders must be created by the app. Otherwise, they will not work.

## Installing Goat Slider

Before anything else, we need to install the app from the Webflow Marketplace. So it will show up on the app explorer in Designer. We recommend installing it on workspace level and not in indivdual project level, so in this way all sites will have it installed automatically.

## Opening the App

After installing the app, you will be able to find the app in the Extensions section in Webflow Designer. Click `Launch`, and that is what takes you inside the Goat Slider app. Now it's time to create your first slider.

## Creating a Slider

Now let's click the `New Slider` button to create a new slider. You will be prompted to enter a name for the slider, and define configurations of the wanted slider. After you have chosen your settings, click "Create", and whala! Your slider is ready to be pasted on your project.

## Editing the Design

Now that your slider is pasted onto your site, you can edit it as you want in the Webflow Designer. And use the app to change the funcionality of it. Very few options are not editable after the slider is pasted. In those case a new slider needs to be created.
