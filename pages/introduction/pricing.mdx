# Pricing

Goat Slider is free for everyone. To use it you only need an account, and that's all. However, we also include a pro plan for people who want to get some more perks and allow us to contribute more in transforming the slider into a more powerful tool.

## Free Plan

With the Free Plan, you can create unlimited sliders with no worries. You can customize it as you want, use animations, copy-paste, and everything else, except for some limitations that will be mentioned below.

## Pro Plan

Pro plan costs $9.99 monthly and includes the following features such as [CMS](https://docs.goatslider.com/functionality/cms), [Counter](https://docs.goatslider.com/functionality/counter), and [Draggable](https://docs.goatslider.com/functionality/draggable). All other features are included by default for each plan.

## How To Subscribe

We've had several questions on how to subscribe to it. In fact, it's very easy. At the top of your profile click the avatar icon, and a dropdown will be shown, and click the option `Subscribe`.

## Canceling the Plan

Canceling the plan is also very easy. You click the profile, and in the dropdown, you click `Manage` and this will redirect you to Stripe to manage it. Then you just click `Cancel Plan`, and that's it. But we always recommend you to contact us before doing it, in case we can help with an issue or something that might frustrate you.

## What Happens After Canceling

If you cancel the plan you will lose the ability to create sliders with pro features for the future sliders. but for the oldest sliders that you have already created and placed into Webflow, you will continue to use them as normal with those Pro features left.

## Other Prices

Besides the normal plan pricing, we have templates that can be purchased separately, each with different pricing. The idea of the templates is for you to use them with just a few clicks. Learn more about the templates and their pricing.

## Refunds

We do not offer refunds for subscriptions or template purchases because of how the business works. But we are always happy to assist and take into consideration your thoughts and feedback.
