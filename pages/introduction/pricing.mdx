# Pricing

Goat Slider is free for everyone. To use it you only need an account, and that's all. However, we also include a pro plan for people who want to get some more perks and allow us to contribute more in transforming the slider into a more powerful tool.

## Free Plan

With the Free Plan, you can create unlimited sliders with no worries. You can customize it as you want, use animations, copy-paste, and everything else, except for some limitations that will be mentioned below.

## Pro Plan

Pro plan costs $9.99 monthly and includes the following features such as [CMS](https://docs.goatslider.com/functionality/cms), [Counter](https://docs.goatslider.com/functionality/counter), and [Draggable](https://docs.goatslider.com/functionality/draggable). All other features are included by default for each plan.

## How To Subscribe

We've had several questions on how to subscribe to it. In fact, it's very easy. At the top of your profile click the avatar icon, and a dropdown will be shown, and click the option `Subscribe`.

## Canceling the Plan

Canceling the plan is also very easy. You click the profile, and in the dropdown, you click `Manage` and this will redirect you to Stripe to manage it. Then you just click `Cancel Plan`, and that's it. But we always recommend you to contact us before doing it, in case we can help with an issue or something that might frustrate you.
