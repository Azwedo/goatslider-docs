# Animations

Animations are the same in Webflow; we've just added the ability for you to use them for each slide change, similar to the native Webflow slider interaction on change. However, there is one limitation: the animations should be structured as on-click trigger.

Well, there is a catch, you need to apply that animation to the element that you want to animate using the Goat Slider app, even if the animation is built on top of Webflow.

## Button Element

When an animation is applied to a button or link element, the animation will play, but the element will not function as a clickable link or button. In most cases this is not a usable case but make sure you are aware of this limitation.

## A Deep Dive

Our team created a dedicated video on how Animations work, how to create them and apply to elements.
