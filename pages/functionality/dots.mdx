# Dots

Dots are a very important part of all the sliders. They allow users to navigate between the pages and see the count of the sliders. In contrast to arrow navigation, which will not let you skip slides, dots navigation will allow you to skip to the point you want.

The styles can be extended as much as you want; you can include animations and hover effects, and also style the states of the dots.

## Circle Dots

This type of dot is the most common one. It's simple and clear, consisting of rounded dots with your favorite style, but it is no more dynamic than showing the size of the dot and navigating when cliking upon them.

## Numbered Dots

This type is more informative. Besides the dots, it includes the number of that slide, so the user can see the count as numbers, not just dots. Also the same they are navigatable upon clicking.

    In Webflow, only two dots are shown: when it is active and when it is not. However, in production, the length will be the same as the slide count.
