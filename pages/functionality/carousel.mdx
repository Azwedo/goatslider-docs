# Carousel

In contrast to the Slider Type, Carousel is not a full hero-sized structure. Carousels can contain more slides per view (we recommend 4-5). Usually, this is used a lot to list blogs, features, testimonials, recipes, and much more.

Carousels can also be nested on top of each other, with some limitations in certain cases.

## Out Of The Box
You can experiment with the sliders, even breaking their concepts. For example, trying to use the full-width sliders (one per view) even though Carousel is built to support multiple. Since we couldn't test all the edge cases, feel free to explore.

## Slide Transitions
Transitions for Carousel types are not supported because of their structure.

## Other Features
The key differences were mentioned; everything else is the same as Slider Type.

<Callout>
    Slider Types can't be changed after the slider is created. If you want to change the type, you need to create a new slider.
