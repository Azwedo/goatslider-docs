# What is Goat Slider?
 
Goat Slider allows the **Webflow** community to build sliders within the *Webflow Designer*. It easily outperforms some of the Webflow native slider functionalities and brings an easy way to **build**, **manage**, and **ship** **super creative** sliders all for free. Like a 🐐.

## What Is The Documentation For?

The app is relatively new on the market, and it brings some very different approaches to building sliders. While the community needs a clear and easy way to understand its concepts and how to use it we have decided to build this documentation. In fact this was the most asked feature by the community.

## Open Documentation

With the documentation we wanted to take a different approach, and make it public so everyone can add something we might have missed because of the edge cases we can't cover, or grammar issues that can be improved. We reward contributions ideas with premium slider templates sometimes.
