# Custom Options

This section requires some developer knowledge and covers optional, in-depth features that you might find useful. We'll discuss these features until they become a standard part of the app.

## Custom Css Classes

On all sliders, we append certain classes that you can use to further customize the slider. In the **Infinite Slider**, we inject two classes for the next slides and two for the previous slides. However, in **Non-Infinite** sliders, we inject two classes if there are more slides, one if there is only one additional slide, and none if there are no more slides.

```css
.goat-next {
    /* This is applied to next slide */
    transform: scale(1.1);
}

.goat-next-next {
    /* This is applied to the slide after the next slide */
    transform: scale(1);
}

.goat-prev {
    /* This is applied to the previous slide */
    transform: scale(0.9);
}

.goat-prev-prev {
    /* This is applied to the slide before the previous slide */
    transform: scale(0.8);
}
```

    We haven't tested all the edge cases for this one, and we don't provide support for it at the moment. However, you can explore it.
